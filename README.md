The Calculator_manual provides an interface with two key features. 
a) The entry window; that allows the user to type the operation that needs to be performed. 
b) The result just below the window. 

The Calculator_gui is a more advanced design that replicates the simple calculator. It provides the user with: 
a) all the numbers;
b) all the simple arithmetic operators and 
c) an entry window for the user to see the operation performed within it. 

Use these calculators anywhere on the go with your systems.
